# âš¡How to - vite-plugin-watch-and-run

<br />
## Installation

If you have `@kitql/all-in` you don't need to install this manually.

If you want to install it stand alone, please do

<PackageInstall packages={['-D @kitql/vite-plugin-watch-and-run']} />

<br />
## Configuration In your `svelte.config.js` add watchAndRun with the following configuration:

- `watch`: a glob pattern to watch for changes. This will be matched against the _absolute path_ for altered files.
- `run`: a command to trigger when a file change is detected (You can be very creative ðŸ¥³!)

```js
import watchAndRun from '@kitql/vite-plugin-watch-and-run'

/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */
const config = {
  kit: {
    vite: {
      plugins: [
        watchAndRun([
          {
            watch: '**/*.(gql|graphql)',
            run: 'npm run gen' // to trigger the script "gen" of your package.json
            // delay: 300, Optional parameter to delay the run command.
            // name: 'kitql tools', Optional parameter to display a name in the terminal
          }
        ])
      ]
    }
  }
}

export default config
```

<br />
## Side Notes

- `delay` is good in case you have 200 files added realy fast! Like this the cmd is executed only once.

- For the `run` command I recommend to use `npm run xxx` as it will work for `npm`, `yarn` and `pnpm` ðŸ™ƒ
